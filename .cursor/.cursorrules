# Rules Index

Quick index of rule files under `./rules/`.

- **Ultracite**: AI-ready formatter and linter rules for strict type safety and a11y

  - File: [rules/ultracite.mdc](rules/ultracite.mdc)
  - Globs: `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`; Always apply: `true`

- **Folder Structure Rules**: Keep code organized by the project layout and import layering
  - File: [rules/folder-strecture.mdc](rules/folder-strecture.mdc)
  - Globs: `**/*`; Always apply: `true`

Usage:

- Follow these rules when adding or editing files. Prefer placing code in the correct layer (`src/app`, `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, `src/providers`, `src/styles`).
- Ultracite tasks: `npx ultracite format` to auto-fix and `npx ultracite lint` to check issues.
