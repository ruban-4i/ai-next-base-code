# Enhanced Route Generation Workflow

**Date**: 19-08-25  
**Status**: Completed

## Overview

Updated the cursor rules to include an interactive clarification step before generating route implementation task files. This ensures better requirement understanding and more accurate code generation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Process Flow

**Before:**

1. User Request → Task File Generation → Manual Review → Implementation

**After:**

1. User Request → **Interactive Clarification** → Task File Generation → Manual Review → Implementation

### 2. Added Interactive Clarification Process

New mandatory step that asks specific questions:

#### Table Display Fields

- Lists all available fields from data shape
- User can copy/paste desired fields
- Provides clear selection guidance

#### Form Fields and Components

- Infers appropriate UI components based on data types:
  - Y/N values → Switch/Toggle component
  - Dates → Date picker component
  - Limited options → Select dropdown
  - Long text → Textarea component
  - Default → Text input

#### CRUD Operation Scope

- Clarifies which operations are needed:
  - Complete CRUD vs Read-only
  - Specific operations only
- Prevents over-engineering

#### Additional Features

- Comprehensive checklist of optional features:
  - Search/Filter functionality
  - Pagination options
  - Export/Import capabilities
  - Bulk operations
  - Audit trail
  - Permission controls

### 3. Enhanced User Interaction Flow

1. **User**: Provides URL and data shape
2. **AI**: Asks clarification questions in structured format
3. **User**: Answers questions (easy copy/paste format)
4. **AI**: Generates comprehensive task file based on clarifications
5. **User**: Reviews task file (can modify manually or via prompts)
6. **User**: Says "go ahead"
7. **AI**: Implements exactly per task file

## Benefits

- ✅ **Requirements Clarity**: No assumptions, exact understanding
- ✅ **Smart UI Components**: Automatic inference from data types
- ✅ **Scope Control**: User defines exactly what's needed
- ✅ **User-Friendly**: Easy copy/paste field selection
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Multiple review points
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can adjust at both clarification and task stages

## Triggers for Clarification

Always ask clarification questions when:

- User requests new route with URL and data shape
- User mentions "end-to-end route creation"
- User provides API data structure or JSON sample
- Request involves CRUD operations
- User asks for table/form functionality with specific data

## Example Clarification Response Template

```markdown
I'll help you create the {route-name} route! Before generating the implementation plan, I need to clarify a few details:

## 1. Table Display Fields

Based on the data shape you provided, here are all available fields:
[List all fields from data shape]

Which fields should be displayed in the table view? Please copy and paste the fields you want to show, or specify them clearly.

## 2. Form Fields and Components

For the create/edit form, please specify:

Available fields and their data types:
[Field name] - [Inferred type based on sample data]

- If field has values like "Y"/"N" or "true"/"false" → Switch/Toggle component
- If field is a date → Date picker component
- If field has limited options → Select dropdown
- If field is long text → Textarea component
- Otherwise → Text input

Which fields should be included in the form and what are their specific data types/components?

## 3. CRUD Operations Scope

What CRUD operations do you need for this route?

- [ ] Create (C) - Add new records
- [ ] Read (R) - List and view records
- [ ] Update (U) - Edit existing records
- [ ] Delete (D) - Remove records

Please specify: Complete CRUD, Read-only, or specific operations only?

## 4. Additional Features

Do you need any additional features?

- [ ] Search/Filter functionality
- [ ] Pagination (default: server-side pagination)
- [ ] Sorting by specific fields
- [ ] Bulk operations (bulk delete, bulk update)
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Import functionality
- [ ] Status management (active/inactive)
- [ ] Audit trail (created/updated timestamps)
- [ ] Permission-based access control
- [ ] Custom validation rules

Once you provide these details, I'll generate a comprehensive task file for your review.
```

## File Updated

- `.cursor/rules/route-generation-tasks.mdc` - Enhanced with interactive clarification process

## Next Steps

The enhanced workflow is now active. When users request route creation with URL and data shape, the AI will automatically trigger the interactive clarification process before generating task files.
